# The create_action() function allows you to create actions that optionally include a target object.
# You can use this function anywhere in your code as a shortcut to add new actions to the activity stream.
# user: The Django User object who performed the action
# verb: A string describing what the user did (e.g., "liked", "commented on")
# target: Optional object that received the action (e.g., a photo that was liked)

        created__gte=last_minute
        # created__gte=last_minute:
        # This part of the query is using Djangoâ€™s ORM lookup syntax. The __gte stands for "greater than or equal to."
        # It means that the query will return all Action records whose created timestamp is later than or equal to last_minute.

# Explanation of the above code:
# The previous click is recorded and remains in the database.
# Every time the function is called, it checks if there's any Action record in the last minute that matches the user,
# verb, and target.
#
# The one-minute check (created__gte=last_minute) works by comparing timestamps:
# It ensures that if a similar action was recorded in the last 60 seconds, no new action is added to avoid duplicates.
#
# New Records After One Minute:
# After the one-minute window, even if the action details (user, verb, target) are the same, the new record is treated
# as a separate event because its timestamp is outside the window of the previous record.
#
# This mechanism helps to prevent accidental multiple clicks (like double-clicks) from creating duplicate actions,
# while still allowing a new action to be recorded if enough time has passed.
